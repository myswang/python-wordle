# python-wordle

A simple CLI Wordle clone made in Python.

## Quick Start

First, clone/download this repository and `cd` into it.

For example, the following commands are applicable to Linux/MacOS:
```
git clone https://github.com/myswang/python-wordle.git
cd python-wordle
```
Then, run the python script:
```
python wordle.py
```
Words are stored in `sgb-words.txt`. You can add/remove additional words here, separated by newlines.

**Note**: Your terminal must support ANSI color escape sequences in order for the letters to be rendered correctly.

Have fun!

## Credits

The word dataset was obtained from the award-winning book [*The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing*](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html) by Donald E. Knuth. You can download the dataset [here](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt).
